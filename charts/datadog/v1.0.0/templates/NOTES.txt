Datadog agents are spinning up on each node in your cluster. After a few
minutes, you should see your agents starting in your event stream:

    https://app.datadoghq.com/event/stream

{{ if .Values.datadog.apiKeyExistingSecret }}
You disabled creation of a secret containing your API key.
Therefore it is expected that you create Secret named '{{ .Values.datadog.apiKeyExistingSecret }}' which includes a key called 'api-key', which actually contains the API key. You can obtain your API key from: https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/kubernetes
{{ end }}
