# Memcached

[Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.

Based on the [memcached](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/incubator/memcached) chart from the [Bitnami Charts](https://github.com/bitnami/charts) repository.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Memcached](https://hub.docker.com/_/memcached/) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.
